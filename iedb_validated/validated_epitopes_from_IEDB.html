Description
This track shows epitope sequences displayed by various class I MHC alleles as annotated by National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). The epitopes with positive assays are displayed on this track. The fields of this track are synonymous to the fields displayed by IEDB data sheet upon exporting it.

EpitopeID is a clickable link to each epitope on IEDB site where details about assays, literature and HLA restriction are provided.
